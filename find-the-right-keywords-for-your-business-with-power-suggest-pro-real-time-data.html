                    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                    <p class="para-blog"><strong>Is there any recurring payment required to use Power Suggest Pro?</strong></p>
                    <p class="para-blog">No, there are absolutely no recurring fees. You will own the lifetime license to use Power Suggest Pro for the one-time price stated above.</p>
                    <p class="para-blog"><strong>Can Power Suggest Pro run on a PC? What versions of Windows does it support?</strong></p>
                    <p class="para-blog">Yes, Power Suggest Pro works on all PCs running Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 or 10.</p>
                    <p class="para-blog"><strong>Is Power Suggest Pro compatible on a Mac?</strong></p>
                    <p class="para-blog">Power Suggest Pro does not run directly on a Mac. However, you can use CrossOver, VMware Fusion or Parallels to run the software on a Mac.</p>
                    <p class="para-blog"><strong>What do the numbers displaying in the search results mean?</strong></p>
                    <p class="para-blog">You'll notice that for each keyword in your search results, a series of numbers is displayed alongside with it. These numbers represent the number of times that specific keyword was suggested by a particular search engine. When only 1 search engine is selected, say Google, these numbers may not seem to be of any use as all the other columns representing Yahoo, Bing, etc will always show a zero. However, when 2 or more search engines were selected for a search, you'll be able to easily tell which keywords were suggested by which search engine(s). You'll also be able to sort the results by clicking on any of the column headers (indicated by the search engines' logos). The last column header (displayed as Σ) represents the total number of times a particular keyword was suggested by all selected search engines. Clicking on Σ sorts the keywords by the total number of times they were suggested, enabling you to quickly spot popular keywords that were simultaneously suggested by multiple search engines.</p>
                    <p class="para-blog"><strong>How many PCs can I install Power Suggest Pro on?</strong></p>
                    <p class="para-blog">Each purchase of Power Suggest Pro usually comes with a license for installation on 1 PC. To sweeten the deal, when you purchase during this offer, your license will be good for installations on up to 3 PCs as long as you are the owner of the PCs. This is great if you frequently work on multiple PCs.</p>
                    <p class="para-blog"><strong>Are future software updates and releases free of charge?</strong></p>
                    <p class="para-blog">Yes, all future updates and releases for Power Suggest Pro will be made available to customers at absolutely no additional charge.</p>
                    <p class="para-blog"><strong>Will I be able to download Power Suggest Pro immediately after payment?</strong></p>
                    <p class="para-blog">Yes, you can be up and running with Power Suggest Pro literally 5 minutes from now.</p>
                    <p class="para-blog">Power Suggest Pro does not currently display the search volumes of keywords from within the software. Power Suggest Pro's prime purpose is focused on harvesting an extensive amount of keywords (significantly more than Google Keyword Planner or typical keyword research tools) and doing so extremely quickly. However, Power Suggest Pro enables you to quickly copy and paste entire lists of keyword results to Google Keyword Planner to get search volume and competition data. To do that, simply click on the "Plain Text" button after a search and you'll be able to quickly export keyword results to Google Keyword Planner or any other preferred tool for analysis.</p>
