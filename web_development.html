                        <p><b>When I began my journey into web development using Python, I chose Flask as my framework because of its simplicity. However, after reading various articles about FastAPI, I decided to create a few projects to learn about the REST protocol and APIs in general.
                            As I worked on these projects, I realized that my applications were starting to grow in complexity. It was natural to migrate to Django, which is a more robust and feature-rich framework. These days, I prefer to write my applications in Django because of its helpful community support and its "batteries included" structure. This means that I can finish my projects faster by using already tested and proven building blocks, which is a huge time-saver.
                            Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced developer, I highly recommend giving Django a try.

This technology enables the application to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the server to fetch data and update the UI accordingly, creating a seamless experience for the user.
                            In addition to the HTMX functionality, this application also incorporates Bokeh, a powerful data visualization library that provides users with highly interactive and engaging graphs. Bokeh allows users to explore data in a visual way, providing more insight and making complex data sets more accessible.

                                The beauty of FastAPI is that it is designed to be performant and easy to use. It's lightweight, so it can handle heavy loads without sacrificing speed. And its intuitive design means that developers can quickly create APIs with minimal code.
