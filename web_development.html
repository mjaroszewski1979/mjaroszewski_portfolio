                        <p><b>When I began my journey into web development using Python, I chose Flask as my framework because of its simplicity. However, after reading various articles about FastAPI, I decided to create a few projects to learn about the REST protocol and APIs in general.
                            As I worked on these projects, I realized that my applications were starting to grow in complexity. It was natural to migrate to Django, which is a more robust and feature-rich framework. These days, I prefer to write my applications in Django because of its helpful community support and its "batteries included" structure. This means that I can finish my projects faster by using already tested and proven building blocks, which is a huge time-saver.
                            Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced developer, I highly recommend giving Django a try.

One of the most noteworthy features of this application is the implementation of drag-and-drop reordering, which enables users to dynamically alter the order of elements in their list, which is then automatically reflected in the database.
                            he integration of HTMX technology into this Django application ensures that the user experience is smooth and seamless. HTMX is a modern tool that simplifies the development process by allowing developers to create interactive web pages with minimal effort.

                            The Django Rest Framework API is a powerful tool for developers who want to create web APIs quickly and easily using the Django framework. With its built-in support for serialization, authentication, and validation, the Django Rest Framework API makes it easy for developers to create robust and secure APIs that can be used by a wide range of applications.
