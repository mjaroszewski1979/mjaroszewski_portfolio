                  >When I began my journey into web development using Python, I
                  chose Flask as my framework because of its simplicity.
                  However, after reading various articles about FastAPI, I
                  decided to create a few projects to learn about the REST
                  protocol and APIs in general. As I worked on these projects, I
                  realized that my applications were starting to grow in
                  complexity. It was natural to migrate to Django, which is a
                  more robust and feature-rich framework. These days, I prefer
                  to write my applications in Django because of its helpful
                  community support and its "batteries included" structure. This
                  means that I can finish my projects faster by using already
                  tested and proven building blocks, which is a huge time-saver.
                  Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced
                  developer, I highly recommend giving Django a try.

                  list management capabilities. Users can effortlessly reorder
                  their list of favorite cars through an intuitive drag-and-drop
                  interface. The application employs HTMX technology, a modern

                  interactive web pages. Project's documentation is automated
                  using Sphinx-apidoc, which builds a well-organized module

                  This project highlights the ease and efficiency of building
                  robust and secure APIs using Django, with built-in support for
                  serialization, authentication, and validation. It integrates
